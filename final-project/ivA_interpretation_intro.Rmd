# About this document

In this document, I begin interpreting my results. I identify the strongest models for regression and classification, examine and compare their variables, and attempt to answer the question of whether the sentiment-based variables are useful in predicting the outputs.

# Best models

## Regression

My best performing regression model

## Classification

# Variable comparison

# Are the sentiment variables useful?
